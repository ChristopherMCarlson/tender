Garnish with dill and additional black pepper. Serve with lemon zest and wedges.\nIf earthy beets aren’t your thing, replace them with vitamin A-packed carrots: Toss 8 oz. carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces, with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper on a separate 10x15-inch rimmed baking sheet. Roast alongside bread in Step 1, adding an additional 15 minutes.Swap out the canned smoked mackerel for 2 (4-oz.) fresh skinless salmon fillets. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook salmon, turning halfway through, until it flakes easily with a fork, 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness. Flake into bite-size pieces.Use pumpernickel, rye, or another whole-grain bread with at least 2 grams of fiber per serving."

Cook, stirring often, until berries fall apart, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove mixture from heat, and pour into a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl. Use the back of a wooden spoon or spatula to press berry mixture through the sieve, extracting as much juice as possible. Discard seeds. Pour sauce back into saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat.",
      "Step 2. Stir cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until thoroughly combined; stir cornstarch slurry into blackberry sauce and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow blackberry sauce to cool completely, about 20 minutes. The sauce can be refrigerated to speed up cooling.",

The edges will bake up taller than the center, and will begin to turn golden brown when they are done. Allow bars to cool to room temperature in the pan, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours to overnight. Cut into 16 bars before serving."
